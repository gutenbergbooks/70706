VICTORY: BEING A CHANT AFTER BATTLE.


    As we marched into the desert
    And sang unto the stars,
    The sky looked kindly on us
    And the pain of battle scars
    No longer seemed to rack us;
    While the folly of the fray
      Was burned upon us,
      Singed upon us,
    Branded by the day;
    Till crimson in that holy night
    Shone forth those deeds of Mars,
    As we marched into the desert
    And hymned unto the stars.

    And backward: trodden was the grass,
    And crimson were the lands,
    And crimson were the ghosts that rose,
    And crimson ran the sands.

    Yet we marched into the desert
    And chanted to the stars.

WHY I AM A PHILISTINE.


I have received a long and carefully written letter from an unknown
gentleman who signs himself “Retired Clergyman.”

The Great Obscure favor me quite often with anonymous epistles, but
life being short and the waste basket wide, I seldom reply. Yet now an
exception must be made and I answer “Retired Clergyman” for the sole and
simple reason that he has “retired,” and in retiring he has made the
world his debtor. Probably no one act of this man’s entire life was so
potent for good as this. He has set all clergymen without humor a most
precious precedent. In gratitude, hoping that his example will bear
fruit, I reply.

Did space permit I would be glad to print my correspondent’s letter
entire, but the gist of his scholarly argument is that The Society of the
Philistines is endeavoring to make free-thought universal and paganism
popular. He stoutly avers that the ancient Philistines were the enemies
of Jehovah, that they worshipped strange gods and that they were the
sworn foes of the Chosen People.

Now this is the sad part: he proves his case.

The gentleman explains that he would not have seen the PHILISTINE
MAGAZINE had not his daughter, “an unmarried lady of thirty-two,”
purchased several copies; but from this on, with his permission, no more
numbers of this “infidelic infernal machine” shall enter his house.

My heart goes out to all unmarried ladies of thirty-two. Especially so
when they have fathers who are irascible; only one worse fate can befall
a woman of thirty-two than to have an irascible father, and that is to
have a lover who is irate. Still I doubt not but that the daughter of
“Retired Clergyman” will find a way to read the PHILISTINE—booklets laugh
at locksmiths!

Yet, ignorance prevails, for is not “Retired Clergyman” living proof? And
so I will say: There lived in the Far East about three thousand years ago
a tribe of people known as Philistines. It is a hotly mooted question
among the theologians whether they were so-called because they lived in
Philistia or whether Philistia took its name on account of being peopled
by Philistines. I will not take sides in this issue, but hedge closely
and simply stand firm on the fact that a tribe called the Philistines
existed. Near them lived the Hivites, the Moabites, the Canaanites, the
Hittites, the Jebusites, the Perizzites, the Ammonites and the Gothamites.

Now among these tribes none were so strong, none so intelligent, none so
virtuous as the Philistines.

And it came to pass that the superior quality of moral fibre in the
Philistines caused the entire country to be known as Philistia; it was
the general name given to the whole valley of the Jordan. And the name
endures even unto this day.

Palestine means the Land of the Philistines.

And it seems that among them there was a rude sense of right and wrong.
For if a man owned a piece of ground and planted a vine on it, and then
watered and tended the vine, the grapes that grew on this vine were his,
and all of the people agreed to this, and the man and his neighbors knew
all this without a Dispensation.

These people planted vineyards, and had gardens, and fields of wheat and
of barley. They had barns with threshing floors, and they had carts,
plows and other implements. They builded houses and owned their homes;
and the men loved their wives and their children; and the women were the
comrades of the men—all taking part in the sports as well as in the work,
for they were a merry, happy people.

Now about thirteen centuries before Christ, while they were living in
peace and prosperity, there swooped down upon them a horde of escaped
slaves, called Israelites. These slaves had broken away from their
masters in Egypt. The country to which they travelled was only about
three hundred miles from Egypt, but as their average speed was less than
a mile a week it took them forty years to make the journey.

The man who led these slaves in their flight was one Moses, who had
killed a man in Egypt and fled. After many years of exile, during which
time he had been in Philistia and liked it, he returned and led the
exodus. When the Israelites left they took all the gold and silver
ornaments and utensils they could “borrow,” and melted them up. And they
were not ashamed of this act, for they have written it down in the third
chapter of a book called Exodus. The ancient Israelites never had any
clear ideas as to the rights of property. When they found grapes growing
on a vine they helped themselves and swore that the fruit was theirs by
Divine right.

In order to impress this ignorant, barbaric horde with the sense of
authority, Moses told the people that God directed him, and that Deity
told him what to do and say.

Moses used to go up on a mountain, clear above the clouds, beyond where
the mists hover, and when he came down the people asked him what he had
been up there for, and he told them he went up to see God. In no other
way could Moses control this restless mob except by saying God says so
and so.

And the fact that their leader was on such good terms with Elohim or
Yoveh, inflated these people so that they always spoke of themselves as
“the Chosen People of God.” The Jebusites, the Hittites and the Moabites
never referred to the Israelites as the Chosen People of God. No one
called them the Chosen People of God—only they themselves.

And I wish to say right here that the individual who does a great and
magnificent work _is_ on close and friendly terms with God. He _is_ the
Son of God, and it is necessary that he should feel this kinship in order
to do his work. From Moses, the called of God, on up to Socrates, who
listened to the Dæmon, to George Fox, who hearkened to the Voice, to
the Prophets of our own time, all lie low in the Lord’s hand and listen
closely ere they act. A man is strong only when he feels that he is
backed by a Power, not his own, that makes for Righteousness.

When I think of these brave souls, the Saviours of the World, who have
sought to lead men out of the captivity of evil—feeling and knowing that
they were the Sons of God—I stand uncovered. But a mass of people—a
crowd, a mob—that claims to be a “Chosen People” is a sight to make
angels weep. “You cannot indict a class” said Macaulay; corporations
have no souls, and a horde that claims to be inspired is only a howling
cowardly Thing. Great men are ever lonely and live apart, but birds of a
feather flock together because they fear to flock alone. They want warmth
and protection—they are afraid. A mob is the quintessence of cowardice—a
dirty, mad, hydra-headed monster, that one good valiant St. George can
thrust to the heart. When a mob speaks I say: Vox populi vox Devil!

At the time the Israelites tumbled in pell-mell onto the Philistines
Moses had long been dead. The mob was without a leader and quarrel was
rife amid its broken ranks. In a mad rush they stampeded the herds of
the Philistines, scattered their flocks, destroyed their gardens, and as
excuse they shouted: We are the Chosen People of God!! And one of their
Poets sang a song, two lines of which runs thus:

    _Moab is my wash-pot,_
    _Over Philistia will I cast my shoe._

This only made the Philistines laugh, and although the Israelites
outnumbered them, they went at it and scattered them. Finally after long
years of warfare, the fight was called a draw, and the Jews settled down
and following the good example of the Philistines made themselves homes.

Of course, as sane men and women, we of today do not suppose that the
great Universal Intelligence that holds the worlds in the hollow of His
hand had much interest in the fight. If this Intelligence were a Being,
I can imagine Him looking over the battlement of Heaven and turning with
a weary smile to Gabriel, saying, “Let ’em fight—what boots it! they will
all be dead tomorrow, anyway.”

It is a noteworthy fact that in the first chapter of the Gospel of St.
Matthew the Inspired Writer traces the genealogy of Jesus direct to the
Philistines. In the sixth verse we find “David begat Solomon of her who
had been the wife of Urias.” Back of this is Ruth the Moabitess, who was
the grandmother of David. There is no such thing as tracing a pure Jewish
lineage back to the time of Moses. The Jews went a courting as soon as
they arrived on the borders of Canaan; and the heathen quite fancied the
Israelitish women from the first. In the book of Ruth, first chapter
and fourth verse I see, “And they took them wives out of the country of
Moab.” The houses of Capulet and Montague have ever intermarried—it seems
a quiet way Nature has of playing a little joke.

And after a painstaking study of the matter I am fully convinced that the
sterling qualities in the Jew are derived from his Philistine ancestry.
No one doubts that Solomon was the wisest man that ever was. His mother
was a Philistine. Now no man is ever greater than his mother, and it is
very plain that the great wisdom of Solomon was derived from this pagan
woman whose body nourished him; in whose loving arms he was cradled; and
whose intellect first fired his aspiration. This is all made plainer yet
when we remember that David had many sons by Jewish women, and that all
of these sons were positively no good—and some of them very, very bad.
The facts are found in the Second Book of Samuel—a book, by the way,
which no respectable girl should allow her mother to read.

But if any captious critic arises and denies the Law of Heredity, for
argument’s sake, I’ll waive this matter of maternal transmission of
excellence and rest my case as to Solomon’s wisdom on the fact that
he married over four hundred Philistine women. And as stated by Sir
Walter Besant in a recent story, “a newly married woman always tells her
husband everything she knows,” I will feel safe in saying that Solomon’s
transcendent wisdom was derived from Philistinic sources.

Only one incident in the history of this people do I wish to set straight
before the world at this writing—that is the story of Goliath. According
to recently discovered cuneiform inscriptions it is found that the giant
lived long enough to attend the funeral of David, so it is hardly likely
that David slew him. David probably threw pebbles at the warrior, but
the giant of course paid no attention to the boys that followed him—going
along about his business just as any other dignified giant would have
done. But David went home and told that he had killed the man—and the
Israelites wishing to leave a proud record wrote the tale down as
history. This story was interpolated into the Bible during the fore part
of the Third Century.

In David’s case summer and autumn quite fulfilled the promise of spring.
That eleventh chapter of Second Samuel, showing how he stole Bath-Sheba
and then killed Uriah, her husband, reveals the quality of the man. But
it was left for his dying act to crown a craven career. With his last
lingering breath—with the rattle of death in his throat—he gasped to his
son, referring to a man who had never wronged him, “His hoar head bring
thou down to the grave in blood!” With the utterance of these frightful
words his soul passed out into the Unknown. In all that David wrote not
a word can I find that hints at his belief in a future life—he simply
never thought of it! and dying as a dog dies, he gnashed at Shimei, whose
offense was that thirty-five years before he had told David a little
wholesome truth. Shimei was a brave fellow and David dare not fight him,
so he made a truce with him and swore an oath that he would never molest
him, but dying he charged Solomon to search him out with a sword. This
is recorded by the Inspired Writer in the ninth verse of the second
chapter of First Kings.

With forty-one distinct crimes to David’s charge, the killing of nine
hundred thousand men and two hundred thousand women and children, the
houghing of thousands of horses, all of which is set down in infallible
Holy Writ, his record is very bluggy. In fact, his whole life’s pathway
is streaked with infamy.

David being a literary man of acknowledged merit, I have given him more
attention than I would a plain, every-day king. And I now brand him
as an all ’round rogue. I do this calmly, holding myself personally
responsible, and fully prepared to plead justification and prove my case
should the heirs or next-of-kin consider my language libellous.

So far as I can ascertain, Dagon was eminently respectable. I cannot find
a single stain on his record; while as for Jehovah, goodness me! If half
that His Chosen People tell about him is true, he surely wasn’t very nice.

And while I do not know anything about it for certain, it is my opinion
that at the Last Great Day the folks who stayed around home and pruned
their vines and tended their flocks and loved their wives and babies
will fare a deal better than those other men who made war on innocent
people and tried to render them homeless. Of course I may be wrong about
this, but I cannot help having an opinion.

Altogether, my sympathies are with the Philistines—who were so strong
in personality that they gave their name to the Holy Land—_Pelishton_,
_Pelesheth_, _Philistia_, Palestina, PALESTINE.


II.

Long years ago Professor Jowett called attention to the fact that the
word Philistia literally meant Land of Friendship: the term having the
same root as the Greek word Philos—Love. Max Muller has recently said:
“The dwellers in the Valley of the Jordan, in the fifteenth century
before Christ, recognizing the idea of Oneness or Fraternity, gave a name
that signified Love-Land to their country: thus embodying the modern
thought of the Brotherhood of Man.”

In view of these things it was rather a strange move—a man so scholarly
as Matthew Arnold applying the word “Philistine” as a term of reproach
toward those who did not think as he did! I can see though that he shaped
his language to fit the ears of his clientele. He sought to make clever
copy—and he did. The opinion being abroad that the Philistines were the
enemies of Light—how very funny to throw the word like a mud ball at any
and all who chanced to smile at his theories! Having small wit of their
own, the scribbling rabble took it up.

On reading certain books by a Late Critic, who now wears prison garb and
is doing the first honest work that ever his hands found to do, I see
that he is very fond of calling people who are outside of his particular
cult, “Philistines.”

But look you! Brave Taurus at the bull-fight is a deal more worthy of
respect than the picadores who for a price harry him without ruth to his
death. And as his virtue surpasses that of any in the silken, belaced
and perfumed throng who sit safe and with lily fingers applaud, so do we
accept your banderilla, recognizing from whence it comes, and wear it
jauntily as a badge of honor.

As the Cross for eighteen hundred years has been a sacred emblem, and
the gallows since John Brown glorious; and as the word Quaker, flung in
impudent and impotent wrath, now stands for gentleness, peace and truth,
so has the word Philistine become a synonym for manly independence.

In Literature he is a Philistine who seeks to express his personality in
his own way. A true Philistine is one who brooks no let nor hindrance
from the tipstaffs of letters, who creating nothing themselves yet are
willing for a consideration to show others how. These men strive hard
to reduce all life to a geometrical theorem and its manifestations to an
algebraic formula. But life is greater than a college professor, and so
far its mysteries, having given the slip to all the creeds, are still at
large. My individual hazard at truth is as legitimate as yours. The self
appointed beadles of letters demand that we shall neither smile nor sleep
while their Presiding Elders drone, but we plead in the World’s Assize
for the privilege of doing both.

In Art we ask for the widest, freest and fullest liberty for
Individuality—that’s all!

CHOPIN AND GEORGE SAND.

THE LITTLE WHITE BLACK BIRD.


The game of tit for tat is rarely graceful or dignified. And yet the
man who “turns the other cheek” has not appealed strongly to the robust
sensibilities of any age. His behavior we cannot admire; it is too much
that of Sterne’s ass, who says meekly to his tormentor, “Please do not
hit me again—but if you will, you may.” Such a course surely no one of
us can be called upon to follow. Besides, the animal acted merely on
instinct, as one of a race of craven unfortunates, who while alive are
peculiarly seductive to stripes, and whose hides after death, as we all
know, are made into drums.

Perhaps the proper rule of conduct lies somewhere in between this
hypocritical or recreant meekness on the one hand, and on the other that
unchristian and vulgar manner of retaliation against which, it must have
been, that the precept of the Bible was directed.

The “lex talionis” in its literal meaning, “an eye for an eye,” and “a
tooth for a tooth,” is certainly barbarous; but surely if mine enemy has
plucked out one of my eyes, and so increased considerably the market
value of the one remaining, no dilettante in morals or the market would
deny my right to sell the other dearly, nor my privilege to write a book
upon my loss. Indeed, men’s enemies from the days of Solomon have never
asked for more than this.

It has been impossible to discover the exact cause which led to the
rupture between Chopin, the musician, and George Sand. However caused,
this rupture was final and was followed almost at once by the novelist’s
publication of her _Lucrezia Floriani_, in which, under the mask of
Prince Karol, she caricatured the sensitive Chopin, holding him up
to ridicule and contempt, and wounded him deeply. As we know, the
excitement following this event and the mental distress and mortification
connected with it threw the musician once more upon the sick bed,
where he lingered a long time, really dangerously ill. We know too that
he recovered. It was then that he wrote and distributed among the old
friends of the “Nohant days,” and among the world of arts and letters in
Paris, with which he and George Sand were so closely associated, a story
called the “Little White Black Bird,” known to us of the present day, by
tradition only.

And it is because this tradition, at least as far as I have learned, has
reached but few people, that I have taken it upon myself to tell simply,
as I have heard it, this story of the “Little White Black Bird,” which,
as an act of retaliation, was, we must confess, a dignified and just
one, and which apart from this, forms an allegory that is beautiful and
perhaps instructive.

       *       *       *       *       *

There was once a little white bird that lived in such a beautiful forest
that one might think no creature with such a home and such a playground
could fail to be happy. But in truth this little bird was far from happy,
because of his loneliness, for in all that wood there seemed to be no
white bird but himself. There were many other birds there, but they were
all black; these had their mates and their nests where they rested at
night, and whence early in the morning they would fly away together,
making the silent woods echo with their song, peeping at the little
elves, one of whom lives hidden away in each beautiful flower and plant,
and sharing with each other all that they learned of the wonderful world
about them. All this the white bird knew they did, for in his loneliness
he watched them closely, following them often a long distance in their
flights, grateful for even this companionship. And always he looked about
him for that little white object, which vaguely, in his dreams perhaps,
he felt he might one day find in this mysterious forest, and which might
prove to be his mate.

And one bright happy day this happened: he found another little white
bird who seemed to have suffered for companionship just as he had done,
and they built their home upon a lofty tree and there they lived, and
life seemed to him a wonderful thing and full of joy. For many days this
lasted.

But at last there came a dark morning; all day the rain poured steadily
down and the two little birds stood, huddled, side by side upon the tree,
their feathers draggled and their bodies cold with the damp and wind.
Since early morning the little white bird had been sad, and his heart
full of misgivings, yet it was a great comfort to him through all the
storm, to turn from time to time and look at the little figure at his
side, and know that his precious companion was near him. But once as he
looked, he seemed to see a wonderful change coming over the little bird.
Could the dark light of the forest, he wondered, be misleading him: yet
as he watched and watched he saw it all too clearly: his companion was
becoming jet black, like the other birds he had seen about him in the
forest. Soon the rain washed away the last little speck of white covering
and then with an angry cry, knowing that she had been found out, she flew
away, and doubtless joined her real companions in the wood. So thus he
saw how he had been deceived, and that all along this had been merely
a little black bird, painted white, who had at first, through the days
of sunshine, played her part well, but who, at the coming of the first
storm, had been shown forth in her true color.

The little “white black bird” and Chopin met but once again. The former
in _Ma Vie_ gives this laconic account of the meeting “Je serrai sa main
tremblante et glacée. Je voulu lui parler, il s’echappa.”

DO POSTERS POST?


    Do posters post? although they sprawl
    In loud profusion at each stall;
      Gibson’s pretentious black-and-whites,
      Nankivell’s freaks and Bradley’s frights,
    And Rhead’s red maidens, lean and tall.

    Although we know each artist’s scrawl,
    _The book they note_ we can’t recall;
      And though their wild effect delights,
              Do posters post?

    Their lines and forms our eyes enthrall,
    Their color schemes our tastes appall,
      The keen collector glibly cites
      Beardsley and all his satellites,
    They’re works of art, but after all,
              Do posters post?

TWO FABLES.


THE HORSE AND THE ELK.

An Elk was one day browsing on the twigs in a dingy Forest, when he was
accosted by a Horse who called over a neighboring Fence:

“You look Hungry, Old Man.”

“I am both Hungry and Lonesome,” replied the Elk.

“Well, it’s what you deserve; why don’t you come over into this Pasture
and be Civilized?”

“I prefer the Freedom of the Forest,” replied the Elk.

“But if you joined our Society and submitted to our Rules you might even
associate with me—as it is I’m quite Ashamed to be seen talking to you!”

“To change the subject,” said the Elk, “I just saw two men over in
the edge of the woods coming this way with a Halter, and from their
Conversation I think one of them has Bought a Horse.”

“Oh! oh! oh!” cried the Horse in Consternation, “I do not know who will
be my master nor where my home shall be!”

“I may be uncivilized, but nobody Owns Me,” said the Elk as he dashed
away into the Forest.


THE LUXURIOUS CATS.

A Man living on the Avenue in a Stylish House bought a pair of Cats, as
the place had become infested with Rats.

When this became known to the Rats they were much Concerned and
straightway called a Convention.

When the meeting was called to order a certain Rat that had been a
Commercial Traveller arose and said:

“Be not Alarmed my friends—I know these Cats; they are very slow, being
well fed and proud and prosperous, they are very Lazy.”

Then an old Pessimist Rat arose and said:

“Aye, there may be no immediate Danger, but I have noticed that when
there is a Thomas Cat and a Tabby Cat living on good terms kittens soon
appear. Ah, me! I fear we are Undone.”

Then the Rat that had been On the Road remarked:

“Mr. Chairman, I said that this was a proud, prosperous and stylish pair
of Cats—such Cats, Sir, do not have kittens. Is there any other Business
before the House?”

Two rather remarkable communications have occupied desk room in the
office of John Badenoch, Chicago’s chief of police.

The letters arrived at a grievous moment, for John, who is a Scotchman,
was stinging under a national complication which arose in Milwaukee when
a Teutonic jury decided, with much frothing at the mouth, that a bagpipe
was not a musical instrument, but a doodle sack.

Figure then this mighty chief of blues coming down early to be confronted
with a double decker in a literary way quite beyond his unco’ snod temper.

One began, “Dear Badenoch: See to _this_ will you and oblige——?”

“This” was a tumultuous flutter of philology disturbed to fathomless
import, and it wound up with a tremulous avowal of anticipated success
likely to hail a gathering of the violet-crowned and bulging foreheads
of Chicago’s ham-strung literati, which clan had engaged to frisk anon
at a naughty vaudeville performance. But success is invariably attained
under violent intimidations in Chicago, and the sprinting fawns of
magazine genius who were giving the entertainment grew frightened of its
lofty promises and penned “this” for protection:

    “What I wish you would do, father, is to see Badenoch and beg
    him to put on a special detail of policemen to handle the crowd
    which will inevitably pack the street leading to our rooms
    the night of the show. You can understand that so many of the
    celebrated authors and poets of Chicago convening at once will
    be of the most tremendous public interest, and there will
    surely gather there an unruly mob come to catch a glimpse of
    the celebrities. The officer on this beat can never handle the
    herd alone, we are certain. Fix things.”

It was one of those gentle precautions imperative in the garnering of
prairie brain-sheaves before they are ripe. It was dulcet and hospitable
to see that the Jovian locks of Ham Garland were not pulled out by the
roots by vulgar _menu-people_ who look upon him as the man who invented
a profitless base burner of coal eating propensity; it was thoughtful,
indeed, to prevent the clamor of huzzas when the editor should announce,
“Mr. Cudahy has came,” (the unhappy word editor used in its ancient
horse sense of course). Imagine this author of a symphony in pig skin
bristling with humor bristles which alone have been quoted worth the
price of his book—imagine Cudahy the bovox, anointed, full of his own
bristles, elbowing his luminous way to the vaudeville through hollow
squares of Women Who Wished They Had, and panting Ladies Who Would Like
to Know How! The impressionistic picture conjured up in the excited
mind of the pale but defiant entertainer was that Chicago, startled
out of its rawhide boots at this threat of brain-waves rampant, would
stampede the sacred apartments of the undefiled and snatch the prairie
literati bald-headed. There had arrived a moment when the blushing, the
palpitating host could not tip his laurel at a wise guy angle over his
eye and say “shoo” real loud at rabid possibilities in a suppositious
mob. The squall for assistance was prettily timed and cautiously secret,
but chiefs of police are difficult upon occasion. Mr. Badenoch has been
persistently engaged in convincing the public of Chicago that gambling
was a thing of the past in that pellucid city of oatmeal porridge and
Christian conversation, and his inveterate denials shaped themselves
into a stereotyped response reverberative to the letters. Quoth solemn
John, the chief, who keeps a hay store off days when he is not chasing
the elusive Chicago tin horn gambler and gallant distributor of emerald
merchandise:

    “There must be some mistake about the danger in a convention of
    these Chicago literary people. My agents have given me every
    assurance that no confidence games or persons obtaining money
    under false pretenses have been discovered within the city
    limits. I never heard of any of these literatis myself and do
    not think there need be any scare about a mob looking for them.

It was a calm, still night when the modest vaudeville twinkled and
stragglers in the field of newspaper art and magazine advertising, even
unto Hobo Chatty-Chatfield Tea, crept noiselessly up a deserted avenue
to be welcomed by the disappointed but relieved young hosts who blinked
in hesitating peace at the empty street and the strangely unattended
luminaries who climbed up stairs without interruption or acclaim.

It is probable that the custodian of the Talleyrand Memoirs little knew
what he was doing for American letters when he gave those precious
chestnuts to the _Century_ magazine four or five years ago. We have

a dozen presses in as many different ways as a residuary turkey after
Thanksgiving, and now that he has got down to wishbone soup we are
getting Lincoln in a similar variety of _rechauffés_. I wonder what

“Whether you have bought my book or borrowed it cuts no figure. As to
paying a dollar to the Fresh Air Fund, that is all in a pig’s eye!
Seventeen girls and a Forelady are constantly employed sending out my
autographs. Should the rush continue, if necessary, I’ll put on a night

The cabinet of Living Documents, I understand, contains a series which
will make known to the world the attractions of a gentleman who has
wrought literature by the barrel and is yet largely a creditor to fame.
The pictures will be labelled in the usual per annum way—“Mr. Inkling at
Nine Months,”—“Mr. Inkling as Othello, _etat_ 34,”—“Mr. Inkling at 50,
etc.” Of course we all know that the well of English undefiled is the ink
well, but it took the magazine that prints a million a month (references
in Ann street) to point out by example and advertising the genius that
flows from the molasses and glue roller. It used to be imagined that
cerebration had something to do with literature, but we have changed all
that. It’s just a question of tons of ink. Gray matter is not in it with
dead black. _Vide_ _Munsey’s_ if you doubt it.

time a very noteworthy prestige) was brought before the public; and the
present publishers feel that no apology is needed in presenting to a new
generation of American readers papers of such distinctive biographical
interest and literary value.

FOOTLIGHTS.


_Footlights_, that weekly paper published in Philadelphia, is a clean

interviews with actors, book gossip, news from London and Paris, short

white paper. It has a big circulation, and people read it, but no one can
tell why.

The Roycroft Printing Shop announces for immediate publication an
exquisite edition of the Song of Songs: which is Solomon’s; being a
Reprint of the text together with a Study by Mr. Elbert Hubbard.

In this edition a most peculiar and pleasant effect is wrought by casting
the Song into dramatic form. The Study is sincere, but not serious, and
has been declared by several Learned Persons, to whom the proofsheets
have been submitted, to be a Work of Art. The Volume is thought a seemly
and precious gift from any Wife to any Husband.

The book is printed by hand, with rubricated initials and title page, on
Ruisdael handmade paper. The type was cast to the order of the Roycroft
Shop, and is cut after one of the earliest Roman faces. It is probable
that no more beautiful type for book printing was ever made, and, for
reasons known to lovers of books, this publication will mark an era in
the art of printing in America.

_Only six hundred copies, bound in antique boards, have been made and
are offered for sale at two dollars each, net. There are also twelve
copies printed on Japan vellum throughout, but which are all sold at five
dollars each. Every copy is numbered and signed by Mr. Hubbard. The type
has been distributed and no further edition will be printed._

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
