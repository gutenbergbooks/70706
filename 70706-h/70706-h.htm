</div>

<p class="dropcap">I have received a long and carefully written
letter from an unknown gentleman who signs
himself “Retired Clergyman.”</p>

<p>The Great Obscure favor me quite often with
anonymous epistles, but life being short and the
waste basket wide, I seldom reply. Yet now an
exception must be made and I answer “Retired
Clergyman” for the sole and simple reason that he
has “retired,” and in retiring he has made the world
his debtor. Probably no one act of this man’s entire
life was so potent for good as this. He has set all
clergymen without humor a most precious precedent.
In gratitude, hoping that his example will bear
fruit, I reply.</p>

<p>Did space permit I would be glad to print my
correspondent’s letter entire, but the gist of his
scholarly argument is that The Society of the Philistines
is endeavoring to make free-thought universal
and paganism popular. He stoutly avers that the
ancient Philistines were the enemies of Jehovah,
that they worshipped strange gods and that they
were the sworn foes of the Chosen People.</p>

<p>Now this is the sad part: he proves his case.</p>

<p>The gentleman explains that he would not have
seen the <span class="smcap">Philistine Magazine</span> had not his daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
“an unmarried lady of thirty-two,” purchased several
copies; but from this on, with his permission,
no more numbers of this “infidelic infernal machine”
shall enter his house.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to all unmarried ladies of thirty-two.
Especially so when they have fathers who are
irascible; only one worse fate can befall a woman
of thirty-two than to have an irascible father, and
that is to have a lover who is irate. Still I doubt
not but that the daughter of “Retired Clergyman”
will find a way to read the <span class="smcap">Philistine</span>—booklets
laugh at locksmiths!</p>

<p>Yet, ignorance prevails, for is not “Retired Clergyman”
living proof? And so I will say: There
lived in the Far East about three thousand years ago
a tribe of people known as Philistines. It is a hotly
mooted question among the theologians whether they
were so-called because they lived in Philistia or
whether Philistia took its name on account of being
peopled by Philistines. I will not take sides in this
issue, but hedge closely and simply stand firm on
the fact that a tribe called the Philistines existed.
Near them lived the Hivites, the Moabites, the
Canaanites, the Hittites, the Jebusites, the Perizzites,
the Ammonites and the Gothamites.</p>

<p>Now among these tribes none were so strong, none
so intelligent, none so virtuous as the Philistines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>And it came to pass that the superior quality of
moral fibre in the Philistines caused the entire
country to be known as Philistia; it was the general
name given to the whole valley of the Jordan.
And the name endures even unto this day.</p>

<p>Palestine means the Land of the Philistines.</p>

<p>And it seems that among them there was a rude
sense of right and wrong. For if a man owned a
piece of ground and planted a vine on it, and then
watered and tended the vine, the grapes that grew
on this vine were his, and all of the people agreed
to this, and the man and his neighbors knew all this
without a Dispensation.</p>

<p>These people planted vineyards, and had gardens,
and fields of wheat and of barley. They had barns
with threshing floors, and they had carts, plows and
other implements. They builded houses and owned
their homes; and the men loved their wives and
their children; and the women were the comrades
of the men—all taking part in the sports as well as
in the work, for they were a merry, happy people.</p>

<p>Now about thirteen centuries before Christ, while
they were living in peace and prosperity, there
swooped down upon them a horde of escaped slaves,
called Israelites. These slaves had broken away
from their masters in Egypt. The country to which
they travelled was only about three hundred miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
from Egypt, but as their average speed was less than
a mile a week it took them forty years to make the
journey.</p>

<p>The man who led these slaves in their flight was
one Moses, who had killed a man in Egypt and fled.
After many years of exile, during which time he had
been in Philistia and liked it, he returned and led
the exodus. When the Israelites left they took all
the gold and silver ornaments and utensils they
could “borrow,” and melted them up. And they
were not ashamed of this act, for they have written
it down in the third chapter of a book called Exodus.
The ancient Israelites never had any clear
ideas as to the rights of property. When they found
grapes growing on a vine they helped themselves
and swore that the fruit was theirs by Divine right.</p>

<p>In order to impress this ignorant, barbaric horde
with the sense of authority, Moses told the people
that God directed him, and that Deity told him what
to do and say.</p>

<p>Moses used to go up on a mountain, clear above
the clouds, beyond where the mists hover, and when
he came down the people asked him what he had
been up there for, and he told them he went up to
see God. In no other way could Moses control
this restless mob except by saying God says so and so.</p>

<p>And the fact that their leader was on such good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
terms with Elohim or Yoveh, inflated these people
so that they always spoke of themselves as “the
Chosen People of God.” The Jebusites, the Hittites
and the Moabites never referred to the Israelites
as the Chosen People of God. No one called
them the Chosen People of God—only they themselves.</p>

<p>And I wish to say right here that the individual
who does a great and magnificent work <i>is</i> on close
and friendly terms with God. He <i>is</i> the Son of
God, and it is necessary that he should feel this kinship
in order to do his work. From Moses, the
called of God, on up to Socrates, who listened to
the Dæmon, to George Fox, who hearkened to the
Voice, to the Prophets of our own time, all lie low
in the Lord’s hand and listen closely ere they act.
A man is strong only when he feels that he is
backed by a Power, not his own, that makes for
Righteousness.</p>

<p>When I think of these brave souls, the Saviours of
the World, who have sought to lead men out of the
captivity of evil—feeling and knowing that they
were the Sons of God—I stand uncovered. But a
mass of people—a crowd, a mob—that claims to be
a “Chosen People” is a sight to make angels weep.
“You cannot indict a class” said Macaulay; corporations
have no souls, and a horde that claims to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
be inspired is only a howling cowardly Thing. Great
men are ever lonely and live apart, but birds of a
feather flock together because they fear to flock
alone. They want warmth and protection—they are
afraid. A mob is the quintessence of cowardice—a
dirty, mad, hydra-headed monster, that one good
valiant St. George can thrust to the heart. When a
mob speaks I say: Vox populi vox Devil!</p>

<p>At the time the Israelites tumbled in pell-mell onto
the Philistines Moses had long been dead. The mob
was without a leader and quarrel was rife amid its
broken ranks. In a mad rush they stampeded the
herds of the Philistines, scattered their flocks, destroyed
their gardens, and as excuse they shouted:
We are the Chosen People of God!! And one of
their Poets sang a song, two lines of which runs thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Moab is my wash-pot,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Over Philistia will I cast my shoe.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This only made the Philistines laugh, and although
the Israelites outnumbered them, they went at it and
scattered them. Finally after long years of warfare,
the fight was called a draw, and the Jews settled
down and following the good example of the Philistines
made themselves homes.</p>

<p>Of course, as sane men and women, we of today
do not suppose that the great Universal Intelligence
that holds the worlds in the hollow of His hand had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
much interest in the fight. If this Intelligence were
a Being, I can imagine Him looking over the battlement
of Heaven and turning with a weary smile to
Gabriel, saying, “Let ’em fight—what boots it!
they will all be dead tomorrow, anyway.”</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that in the first chapter of
the Gospel of St. Matthew the Inspired Writer traces
the genealogy of Jesus direct to the Philistines. In
the sixth verse we find “David begat Solomon of
her who had been the wife of Urias.” Back of this
is Ruth the Moabitess, who was the grandmother of
David. There is no such thing as tracing a pure
Jewish lineage back to the time of Moses. The Jews
went a courting as soon as they arrived on the borders
of Canaan; and the heathen quite fancied the
Israelitish women from the first. In the book of
Ruth, first chapter and fourth verse I see, “And
they took them wives out of the country of Moab.”
The houses of Capulet and Montague have ever intermarried—it
seems a quiet way Nature has of playing
a little joke.</p>

<p>And after a painstaking study of the matter I am
fully convinced that the sterling qualities in the Jew
are derived from his Philistine ancestry. No one
doubts that Solomon was the wisest man that ever
was. His mother was a Philistine. Now no man is
ever greater than his mother, and it is very plain that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the great wisdom of Solomon was derived from this
pagan woman whose body nourished him; in whose
loving arms he was cradled; and whose intellect
first fired his aspiration. This is all made plainer yet
when we remember that David had many sons by
Jewish women, and that all of these sons were positively
no good—and some of them very, very bad.
The facts are found in the Second Book of Samuel—a
book, by the way, which no respectable girl should
allow her mother to read.</p>

<p>But if any captious critic arises and denies the Law
of Heredity, for argument’s sake, I’ll waive this matter
of maternal transmission of excellence and rest
my case as to Solomon’s wisdom on the fact that he
married over four hundred Philistine women. And
as stated by Sir Walter Besant in a recent story, “a
newly married woman always tells her husband
everything she knows,” I will feel safe in saying
that Solomon’s transcendent wisdom was derived
from Philistinic sources.</p>

<p>Only one incident in the history of this people
do I wish to set straight before the world at this
writing—that is the story of Goliath. According to
recently discovered cuneiform inscriptions it is found
that the giant lived long enough to attend the funeral
of David, so it is hardly likely that David slew
him. David probably threw pebbles at the warrior,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
but the giant of course paid no attention to the boys
that followed him—going along about his business
just as any other dignified giant would have done.
But David went home and told that he had killed
the man—and the Israelites wishing to leave a proud
record wrote the tale down as history. This story
was interpolated into the Bible during the fore part
of the Third Century.</p>

<p>In David’s case summer and autumn quite fulfilled
the promise of spring. That eleventh chapter of
Second Samuel, showing how he stole Bath-Sheba
and then killed Uriah, her husband, reveals the quality
of the man. But it was left for his dying act to
crown a craven career. With his last lingering
breath—with the rattle of death in his throat—he
gasped to his son, referring to a man who had never
wronged him, “His hoar head bring thou down to
the grave in blood!” With the utterance of these
frightful words his soul passed out into the Unknown.
In all that David wrote not a word can I find that
hints at his belief in a future life—he simply never
thought of it! and dying as a dog dies, he gnashed
at Shimei, whose offense was that thirty-five years
before he had told David a little wholesome truth.
Shimei was a brave fellow and David dare not fight
him, so he made a truce with him and swore an
oath that he would never molest him, but dying he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
charged Solomon to search him out with a sword.
This is recorded by the Inspired Writer in the ninth
verse of the second chapter of First Kings.</p>

<p>With forty-one distinct crimes to David’s charge,
the killing of nine hundred thousand men and two
hundred thousand women and children, the houghing
of thousands of horses, all of which is set down
in infallible Holy Writ, his record is very bluggy.
In fact, his whole life’s pathway is streaked with
infamy.</p>

<p>David being a literary man of acknowledged
merit, I have given him more attention than I
would a plain, every-day king. And I now brand
him as an all ’round rogue. I do this calmly,
holding myself personally responsible, and fully prepared
to plead justification and prove my case
should the heirs or next-of-kin consider my language
libellous.</p>

<p>So far as I can ascertain, Dagon was eminently
respectable. I cannot find a single stain on his
record; while as for Jehovah, goodness me! If half
that His Chosen People tell about him is true, he
surely wasn’t very nice.</p>

<p>And while I do not know anything about it for
certain, it is my opinion that at the Last Great Day
the folks who stayed around home and pruned their
vines and tended their flocks and loved their wives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and babies will fare a deal better than those other
men who made war on innocent people and tried to
render them homeless. Of course I may be wrong
about this, but I cannot help having an opinion.</p>

<p>Altogether, my sympathies are with the Philistines—who
were so strong in personality that they
gave their name to the Holy Land—<i>Pelishton</i>, <i>Pelesheth</i>,
<i>Philistia</i>, Palestina, PALESTINE.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Long years ago Professor Jowett called attention
to the fact that the word Philistia literally meant
Land of Friendship: the term having the same
root as the Greek word Philos—Love. Max Muller
has recently said: “The dwellers in the Valley
of the Jordan, in the fifteenth century before Christ,
recognizing the idea of Oneness or Fraternity, gave a
name that signified Love-Land to their country: thus
embodying the modern thought of the Brotherhood
of Man.”</p>

<p>In view of these things it was rather a strange
move—a man so scholarly as Matthew Arnold applying
the word “Philistine” as a term of reproach
toward those who did not think as he did! I can
see though that he shaped his language to fit the ears
of his clientele. He sought to make clever copy—and
he did. The opinion being abroad that the Philistines
were the enemies of Light—how very funny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
to throw the word like a mud ball at any and all who
chanced to smile at his theories! Having small wit
of their own, the scribbling rabble took it up.</p>

<p>On reading certain books by a Late Critic, who
now wears prison garb and is doing the first honest
work that ever his hands found to do, I see that he
is very fond of calling people who are outside of his
particular cult, “Philistines.”</p>

<p>But look you! Brave Taurus at the bull-fight is a
deal more worthy of respect than the picadores who
for a price harry him without ruth to his death. And
as his virtue surpasses that of any in the silken, belaced
and perfumed throng who sit safe and with lily
fingers applaud, so do we accept your banderilla,
recognizing from whence it comes, and wear it jauntily
as a badge of honor.</p>

<p>As the Cross for eighteen hundred years has been
a sacred emblem, and the gallows since John Brown
glorious; and as the word Quaker, flung in impudent
and impotent wrath, now stands for gentleness,
peace and truth, so has the word Philistine become
a synonym for manly independence.</p>

<p>In Literature he is a Philistine who seeks to express
his personality in his own way. A true Philistine
is one who brooks no let nor hindrance from the
tipstaffs of letters, who creating nothing themselves
yet are willing for a consideration to show others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
how. These men strive hard to reduce all life to a
geometrical theorem and its manifestations to an algebraic
formula. But life is greater than a college
professor, and so far its mysteries, having given the
slip to all the creeds, are still at large. My individual
hazard at truth is as legitimate as yours. The
self appointed beadles of letters demand that we
shall neither smile nor sleep while their Presiding
Elders drone, but we plead in the World’s Assize
for the privilege of doing both.</p>

<p>In Art we ask for the widest, freest and fullest liberty
for Individuality—that’s all!</p>

<h3>THE LITTLE WHITE BLACK BIRD.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The game of tit for tat is rarely graceful or dignified.
And yet the man who “turns the
other cheek” has not appealed strongly to the robust
sensibilities of any age. His behavior we cannot admire;
it is too much that of Sterne’s ass, who says
meekly to his tormentor, “Please do not hit me
again—but if you will, you may.” Such a course
surely no one of us can be called upon to follow.
Besides, the animal acted merely on instinct, as one
of a race of craven unfortunates, who while alive are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
peculiarly seductive to stripes, and whose hides after
death, as we all know, are made into drums.</p>

<p>Perhaps the proper rule of conduct lies somewhere
in between this hypocritical or recreant meekness on
the one hand, and on the other that unchristian and
vulgar manner of retaliation against which, it must
have been, that the precept of the Bible was directed.</p>

<p>The “lex talionis” in its literal meaning, “an
eye for an eye,” and “a tooth for a tooth,” is certainly
barbarous; but surely if mine enemy has
plucked out one of my eyes, and so increased considerably
the market value of the one remaining, no dilettante
in morals or the market would deny my right
to sell the other dearly, nor my privilege to write a
book upon my loss. Indeed, men’s enemies from the
days of Solomon have never asked for more than this.</p>

<p>It has been impossible to discover the exact cause
which led to the rupture between Chopin, the musician,
and George Sand. However caused, this
rupture was final and was followed almost at once by
the novelist’s publication of her <i>Lucrezia Floriani</i>,
in which, under the mask of Prince Karol, she caricatured
the sensitive Chopin, holding him up to ridicule
and contempt, and wounded him deeply. As
we know, the excitement following this event and the
mental distress and mortification connected with it
threw the musician once more upon the sick bed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
where he lingered a long time, really dangerously ill.
We know too that he recovered. It was then that
he wrote and distributed among the old friends of
the “Nohant days,” and among the world of arts
and letters in Paris, with which he and George Sand
were so closely associated, a story called the “Little
White Black Bird,” known to us of the present day,
by tradition only.</p>

<p>And it is because this tradition, at least as far as I
have learned, has reached but few people, that I have
taken it upon myself to tell simply, as I have heard
it, this story of the “Little White Black Bird,”
which, as an act of retaliation, was, we must confess,
a dignified and just one, and which apart from this,
forms an allegory that is beautiful and perhaps instructive.</p>

<p>There was once a little white bird that lived in
such a beautiful forest that one might think no
creature with such a home and such a playground
could fail to be happy. But in truth this little bird
was far from happy, because of his loneliness, for in all
that wood there seemed to be no white bird but himself.
There were many other birds there, but they
were all black; these had their mates and their
nests where they rested at night, and whence early
in the morning they would fly away together, making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the silent woods echo with their song, peeping at
the little elves, one of whom lives hidden away in
each beautiful flower and plant, and sharing with
each other all that they learned of the wonderful
world about them. All this the white bird knew
they did, for in his loneliness he watched them
closely, following them often a long distance in
their flights, grateful for even this companionship.
And always he looked about him for that little white
object, which vaguely, in his dreams perhaps, he
felt he might one day find in this mysterious forest,
and which might prove to be his mate.</p>

<p>And one bright happy day this happened: he
found another little white bird who seemed to have
suffered for companionship just as he had done, and
they built their home upon a lofty tree and there they
lived, and life seemed to him a wonderful thing and
full of joy. For many days this lasted.</p>

<p>But at last there came a dark morning; all day the
rain poured steadily down and the two little birds
stood, huddled, side by side upon the tree, their
feathers draggled and their bodies cold with the damp
and wind. Since early morning the little white bird
had been sad, and his heart full of misgivings, yet it
was a great comfort to him through all the storm, to
turn from time to time and look at the little figure at
his side, and know that his precious companion was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
near him. But once as he looked, he seemed to see a
wonderful change coming over the little bird. Could
the dark light of the forest, he wondered, be misleading
him: yet as he watched and watched he saw it all
too clearly: his companion was becoming jet black,
like the other birds he had seen about him in the
forest. Soon the rain washed away the last little
speck of white covering and then with an angry cry,
knowing that she had been found out, she flew away,
and doubtless joined her real companions in the wood.
So thus he saw how he had been deceived, and that
all along this had been merely a little black bird,
painted white, who had at first, through the days of
sunshine, played her part well, but who, at the coming
of the first storm, had been shown forth in her
true color.</p>

<p>The little “white black bird” and Chopin met but
once again. The former in <i>Ma Vie</i> gives this
laconic account of the meeting “Je serrai sa main
tremblante et glacée. Je voulu lui parler, il
s’echappa.”</p>

<h3>THE HORSE AND THE ELK.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">An Elk was one day browsing on the twigs in a
dingy Forest, when he was accosted by a Horse
who called over a neighboring Fence:</p>

<p>“You look Hungry, Old Man.”</p>

<p>“I am both Hungry and Lonesome,” replied the
Elk.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s what you deserve; why don’t you
come over into this Pasture and be Civilized?”</p>

<p>“I prefer the Freedom of the Forest,” replied the
Elk.</p>

<p>“But if you joined our Society and submitted to
our Rules you might even associate with me—as it is
I’m quite Ashamed to be seen talking to you!”</p>

<p>“To change the subject,” said the Elk, “I just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
saw two men over in the edge of the woods coming
this way with a Halter, and from their Conversation I
think one of them has Bought a Horse.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried the Horse in Consternation,
“I do not know who will be my master nor where
my home shall be!”</p>

<p>“I may be uncivilized, but nobody Owns Me,”
said the Elk as he dashed away into the Forest.</p>

<h3>THE LUXURIOUS CATS.</h3>

<p>A Man living on the Avenue in a Stylish House
bought a pair of Cats, as the place had become
infested with Rats.</p>

<p>When this became known to the Rats they were
much Concerned and straightway called a Convention.</p>

<p>When the meeting was called to order a certain
Rat that had been a Commercial Traveller arose and
said:</p>

<p>“Be not Alarmed my friends—I know these Cats;
they are very slow, being well fed and proud and
prosperous, they are very Lazy.”</p>

<p>Then an old Pessimist Rat arose and said:</p>

<p>“Aye, there may be no immediate Danger, but I
have noticed that when there is a Thomas Cat and a
Tabby Cat living on good terms kittens soon appear.
Ah, me! I fear we are Undone.”</p>

<p>Then the Rat that had been On the Road
remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, I said that this was a proud,
prosperous and stylish pair of Cats—such Cats, Sir,

<h2 class="nobreak hanging allsmcap" id="SIDE_TALKS_WITH_THE_PHILISTINES">SIDE TALKS WITH THE PHILISTINES:
BEING SUNDRY BITS OF
WISDOM WHICH HAVE BEEN
HERETOFORE SECRETED, AND ARE NOW
SET FORTH IN PRINT.
<img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""></h2>

</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Mr. Laurence Hutton, who writes book advertisements
for <i>Harper’s</i>, says—but goodness gracious!
who cares what Laurence Hutton says?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Two rather remarkable communications have occupied
desk room in the office of John Badenoch, Chicago’s
chief of police.</p>

<p>The letters arrived at a grievous moment, for John,
who is a Scotchman, was stinging under a national
complication which arose in Milwaukee when a Teutonic
jury decided, with much frothing at the mouth,
that a bagpipe was not a musical instrument, but a
doodle sack.</p>

<p>Figure then this mighty chief of blues coming down
early to be confronted with a double decker in a literary
way quite beyond his unco’ snod temper.</p>

<p>One began, “Dear Badenoch: See to <i>this</i> will you
and oblige——?”</p>

<p>“This” was a tumultuous flutter of philology disturbed
to fathomless import, and it wound up with a
tremulous avowal of anticipated success likely to hail
a gathering of the violet-crowned and bulging foreheads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
of Chicago’s ham-strung literati, which clan
had engaged to frisk anon at a naughty vaudeville
performance. But success is invariably attained under
violent intimidations in Chicago, and the sprinting
fawns of magazine genius who were giving the
entertainment grew frightened of its lofty promises
and penned “this” for protection:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What I wish you would do, father, is to see
Badenoch and beg him to put on a special detail of
policemen to handle the crowd which will inevitably
pack the street leading to our rooms the night of the
show. You can understand that so many of the celebrated
authors and poets of Chicago convening at
once will be of the most tremendous public interest,
and there will surely gather there an unruly mob
come to catch a glimpse of the celebrities. The officer
on this beat can never handle the herd alone, we
are certain. Fix things.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was one of those gentle precautions imperative
in the garnering of prairie brain-sheaves before they
are ripe. It was dulcet and hospitable to see that
the Jovian locks of Ham Garland were not pulled
out by the roots by vulgar <i>menu-people</i> who look upon
him as the man who invented a profitless base burner
of coal eating propensity; it was thoughtful, indeed,
to prevent the clamor of huzzas when the editor
should announce, “Mr. Cudahy has came,” (the
unhappy word editor used in its ancient horse sense
of course). Imagine this author of a symphony<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
in pig skin bristling with humor bristles which alone
have been quoted worth the price of his book—imagine
Cudahy the bovox, anointed, full of his own
bristles, elbowing his luminous way to the vaudeville
through hollow squares of Women Who Wished They
Had, and panting Ladies Who Would Like to Know
How! The impressionistic picture conjured up in
the excited mind of the pale but defiant entertainer
was that Chicago, startled out of its rawhide boots at
this threat of brain-waves rampant, would stampede
the sacred apartments of the undefiled and snatch the
prairie literati bald-headed. There had arrived a
moment when the blushing, the palpitating host
could not tip his laurel at a wise guy angle over his
eye and say “shoo” real loud at rabid possibilities
in a suppositious mob. The squall for assistance was
prettily timed and cautiously secret, but chiefs of police
are difficult upon occasion. Mr. Badenoch has
been persistently engaged in convincing the public of
Chicago that gambling was a thing of the past in that
pellucid city of oatmeal porridge and Christian conversation,
and his inveterate denials shaped themselves
into a stereotyped response reverberative to
the letters. Quoth solemn John, the chief, who
keeps a hay store off days when he is not chasing the
elusive Chicago tin horn gambler and gallant distributor
of emerald merchandise:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There must be some mistake about the danger
in a convention of these Chicago literary people.
My agents have given me every assurance that no
confidence games or persons obtaining money under
false pretenses have been discovered within the city
limits. I never heard of any of these literatis myself
and do not think there need be any scare about
a mob looking for them.</p>

<p>“(Signed)</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">J. J. Badenoch</span>,<br>
“Police Sup’t. and Feed Store, Chicago.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was a calm, still night when the modest vaudeville
twinkled and stragglers in the field of newspaper
art and magazine advertising, even unto Hobo Chatty-Chatfield
Tea, crept noiselessly up a deserted avenue
to be welcomed by the disappointed but relieved
young hosts who blinked in hesitating peace at the
empty street and the strangely unattended luminaries
who climbed up stairs without interruption or acclaim.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> The railroad reporter of the Buffalo <i>Express</i> is a
lightning calculator. He figured out the time made
by the Empire State Express on its famous run the
other day and said, “This is at the rate of less than
a mile a minute.” Father has an old cow out in the
pasture, and when she gets real scared she can run
less than a mile a minute, and she doesn’t seem to be
going so fast either.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> The Editor of the <i>Chip-Munk</i>, dead beat out, brain-tired
and on the verge of hysteria, acknowledges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
that he can no longer keep up with the procession.
So he advertises for men to write his
“Notes,” and offers a prize of five dollars to the
fellow who sends in the best one, and a booby prize
of fifty cents for the worst. Earl &amp; Wilson’s hands
are at it sharp, and we may soon expect something
choice. Now is the time to subscribe.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> We understand that the principle of writing
“according to one’s lights” is an admirable one
and worthy of all Philistinical endorsement. This is
undoubtedly true, but we learn on excellent authority
that William Winter writes according to his liver—a
physiological aberration from the true principle.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> It is probable that the custodian of the Talleyrand
Memoirs little knew what he was doing for American
letters when he gave those precious chestnuts to the
<i>Century</i> magazine four or five years ago. We have
had little but Napoleon since. The Little Corporal
has been done up on a dozen presses in as many
different ways as a residuary turkey after Thanksgiving,
and now that he has got down to wishbone
soup we are getting Lincoln in a similar variety of
<i>rechauffés</i>. I wonder what graveyard will be dug up
next?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Under the thrilling caption of “Three Hundred
Dollars for a Girl,” I read that “an Italian sold his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
daughter to a man at Dunbar, Pennsylvania.” That
is outrageous. No such sale should be allowed
under a million dollars.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Mr. Cudahy is sending a curious circular to his
friends and his enemies, offering to supply his autograph,
made with a rubber stamp, to all who apply.
The circular has the somewhat startling headline,
“The World is my Meat!” The closing paragraph
of this address is as follows:</p>

<p>“Whether you have bought my book or borrowed
it cuts no figure. As to paying a dollar to the
Fresh Air Fund, that is all in a pig’s eye! Seventeen
girls and a Forelady are constantly employed sending
out my autographs. Should the rush continue, if
necessary, I’ll put on a night gang—working double
shift. Autograph Fiends should direct: Cudio of Mr.
Studahy, Caxton Building, Chicago; thus avoiding
the delay incident to the mail that goes <i>via</i> the
Abattoir.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Some jokes are funny because they are not humorous.
Richard Mansfield is to renounce the stage for
the lecture platform.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> By whom the offence cometh, let him heed the
words of the Forecaster, for it is written in the
twenty-sixth verse of the fourteenth chapter of Second
Samuel:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when he polled his head, for it was at
every year’s end that he polled his head; because
the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it,
he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred
shekels.”</p>

</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> His name is John Bryan of Ohio. Whoever says
otherwise is a rogue and a varlet.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> A feature of the forthcoming <i>Boklet</i> will be “How
I Chase My Ink,” by the editor of <i>Monthly’s</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> I hereby warn the public against a certain heretical
book called <i>Fables and Essays</i> by Hon. John
Bryan, Member of Congress. The two fables in
this issue are taken from this volume.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> The cabinet of Living Documents, I understand,
contains a series which will make known to the world
the attractions of a gentleman who has wrought literature
by the barrel and is yet largely a creditor to
fame. The pictures will be labelled in the usual per
annum way—“Mr. Inkling at Nine Months,”—“Mr.
Inkling as Othello, <i>etat</i> 34,”—“Mr. Inkling at 50,
etc.” Of course we all know that the well of English
undefiled is the ink well, but it took the magazine that
prints a million a month (references in Ann street)
to point out by example and advertising the genius
that flows from the molasses and glue roller. It used
to be imagined that cerebration had something to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
with literature, but we have changed all that. It’s
just a question of tons of ink. Gray matter is not in
it with dead black. <i>Vide</i> <i>Munsey’s</i> if you doubt it.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> An unknown correspondent writes me from New
Medford, Massachusetts, stating that faint glimmering
recollections of a former Philistinic existence flit
across her mind as she contemplates Tenet Number
Thirty Nine of our Creed: “This earth is Hell and we
are now being punished for sins committed in a former
existence.” Then she says that Dagon must be very
merciful, otherwise he would not provide so many good
laughs, supplied by his Inspired Servants the editors
of <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span>.</p>

<p>Thank you Unknown Fair One—(Subscription rates
one dollar per year, payable to the Bursar).</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Mr. Cæsar Lombroso of the University of Tureen
has fallen into the soup. Having found something
he admired in another man’s book he pinched it.
The other man, whose name is Jamin, brought suit
and the godfather of Max Nordau was fined twenty-five
hundred francs and costs. I have just figured out
that had a man I know been fined this amount for
taking his own wherever he found it, “he and some
other fellows” would be in debt to the sum of sixty-three
million piastres, with an alternative of a hundred
and eighty years in gaol. Thank God! we live
in a free country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> A new woman has just written me that C. Lombroso,
having told all he knew about the Female
Offender, is now writing his autobiography.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> One of my most valued correspondents criticises
my proofreading and alleges that she could do
it better herself. She says, “The next time I pass
through East Aurora I’ll stop off.” How can she
pass through and still stop off? The gods give us
joy! I fancy the sight of such an attempted feat
would give me a new thrill.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> A whole half column of heavy criticism is leveled
at the Philistines by the New York <i>Tribune</i> because,
as alleged, they “lauded Stephen Crane to the
Skies” at the recent Square Meal. I don’t think it’s
necessary to defend Mr. Crane against the Serious
Critic, but one thing may be said in his favor by way
of contrast: he knows a joke at sight.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Some years ago, when Mrs. Dr. Barrows changed
the name of her paper from <i>The Fireside Friend</i> to
<i>The Christian Register</i>, in a desire to be up to date,
she was harshly criticised. But the <i>Register</i> is hot
stuff, just the same, although not orthodox.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> Judge Tourgee’s <i>Basin</i> has a new cover. Now, if
it could get a new inside, how nice it would be!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco4.jpg" alt=""> It is time Bliss Carman came from Behind the
Arras and told us about it.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
